# cips

This is the official repository for the Cartesi Improvement Proposal (CIP) governance system.

Cartesi Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Cartesi platform.

Before you initiate a pull request, please read the [CIP-1 process document](cips/cip-1.md). Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request in this repository. That discussion should specifically take place in a master GitHub issue opened in this repository for each CIP.

There can be discussion about a CIP elsewhere, but a master Github issue must be opened in this repository to represent the entire discussion about each CIP. The CIP's master issue can then link to other issues or other threads in other forums that also discuss the CIP.
