# cips

This is the official repository for the Cartesi Improvement Proposal (CIP) governance system.

Cartesi Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Cartesi platform.

Before you initiate a pull request, please read the [CIP-1 process document](cips/cip-1.md). Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request in this repository. That discussion should specifically take place in a [Cartesi Governance Forum](https://github.com/cartesi/cips/discussions) thread that is opened for each CIP.

There can be discussion about a CIP elsewhere, but a master discussion thread on the governance forum must be opened to represent the entire discussion about each CIP. The CIP's master thread can then link to other threads in the Github Discussions forum or in other forums that also discuss the CIP.
