This is the suggested template for new CIPs.

Note that an CIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your CIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `CIP-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
A motivation section is critical for any CIP. It must explain what is the alleged problem being solved and why it is important that we solve it. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow implementers to translate the CIP into changes to computer programs, documents or processes, as needed.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility
All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
This section is optional. Tests should either be inlined in the CIP as data (such as input/expected output pairs, or included in `../assets/cip-###/<filename>`.

## Reference Implementation
This section is optional; it provides a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.

## Security Considerations
All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks, and can be used throughout the life-cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A CIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
